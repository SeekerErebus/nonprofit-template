        Winter Wildlife Survey Reveals Healthy Moose Population
      </h1>

          Our annual winter wildlife survey, conducted in partnership with the Utah Division of Wildlife Resources, has confirmed stable and healthy moose populations across the central Wasatch Range. The survey, which combines aerial flyovers with ground-based observation, counted 47 moose in our study area -- consistent with the 5-year average and including 8 calves born in 2025.

          "Seeing calves is always encouraging," said Marcus Chen, our Director of Conservation. "It tells us the habitat is healthy enough to support reproduction and that our corridor protection efforts are making a difference."
        </p>

        <p>
          The winter survey also documented mule deer herds, elk, and several raptor species. Camera traps set across the study area captured images of a mountain lion and a pine marten -- both indicators of a healthy, diverse ecosystem.
