          Our 2025 Annual Conservation Gala was a resounding success, bringing together 300 supporters at The Grand America Hotel for an evening celebrating Utah's wild places and the people who protect them. The event raised a record $180,000 -- funds that will directly support habitat restoration, wildlife monitoring, and education programs in 2026.

        <h2 class="font-display text-2xl font-bold text-stone-900 mt-8 mb-4">Evening Highlights</h2>
        <p>
          The evening featured a keynote address by Dr. Rebecca Torres, director of the Western Wildlife Corridor Initiative, who spoke about the critical role regional nonprofits play in national conservation strategy. Guests enjoyed a silent auction featuring donated outdoor experiences, local art, and adventure packages.

          Executive Director Dr. Sarah Whitfield presented the year's conservation highlights, including the 15,000-acre protection milestone and the expansion of the Jr. Ranger program. "Every person in this room is part of this story," she said. "Conservation isn't something that happens to a community -- it happens because of a community."
        </p>
        <h2 class="font-display text-2xl font-bold text-stone-900 mt-8 mb-4">Thank You</h2>
        <p>
          We extend our heartfelt thanks to our event sponsors, silent auction donors, and every guest who attended and gave so generously. Your investment in conservation will pay dividends for years to come.
