        Jr. Ranger Program Expands to 15 New Schools
      </h1>

        <p>
          We're thrilled to announce that our Jr. Ranger program will expand to 15 additional schools across the Wasatch Front this spring, bringing our total to 45 partner schools and an estimated 10,000 students reached annually.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Jr. Ranger program, launched in 2016, provides hands-on environmental education to students in grades 3 through 8. Through field trips, classroom visits, and outdoor learning sessions, students learn about local ecosystems, wildlife identification, and conservation practices.
        </p>
        <h2 class="font-display text-2xl font-bold text-stone-900 mt-8 mb-4">What Students Experience</h2>
        <p>
          Each participating class receives four sessions throughout the school year: a classroom introduction to local ecosystems, a guided nature walk at a nearby natural area, a hands-on stream ecology lesson, and a culminating restoration project where students plant native species.
        </p>
        <p>
          "When a kid pulls on waders for the first time and steps into a creek to count macroinvertebrates, you can see the spark," said Elena Vasquez, our Education & Outreach Manager. "That's the moment a young person becomes a conservationist."
        </p>
        <h2 class="font-display text-2xl font-bold text-stone-900 mt-8 mb-4">How You Can Help</h2>
        <p>
          The expansion is made possible by generous donors and dedicated volunteer educators. A $500 donation sponsors one classroom's entire year of programming. If you're a teacher interested in bringing the Jr. Ranger program to your school, or a volunteer who wants to help lead sessions, please <a href="/volunteer/" class="text-forest-600 hover:text-forest-800 font-semibold underline">get in touch</a>.
