        Spring Restoration Season Kicks Off Along Big Cottonwood Creek

        <p>
          As snow begins to melt in the Wasatch canyons, our conservation team is gearing up for the largest restoration project of the year. Starting March 15, over 200 volunteers will join our biologists along a 3-mile stretch of Big Cottonwood Creek to restore critical streambank habitat.
        </p>
        <p>
          The project focuses on three key areas: removing invasive plant species that have taken root along the creek banks, replanting native willows, sedges, and other riparian vegetation, and stabilizing eroded sections of the streambank using bioengineering techniques.
        </p>
        <h2 class="font-display text-2xl font-bold text-stone-900 mt-8 mb-4">Why This Matters</h2>
        <p>
          Healthy riparian corridors are the backbone of the Wasatch ecosystem. These narrow strips of vegetation along waterways provide habitat for over 70% of the region's wildlife species, filter pollutants from runoff, and help regulate stream temperatures critical for native Bonneville cutthroat trout.
        </p>
        <p>
          Years of recreational use, development pressure, and invasive species have degraded many of these corridors. Our restoration work aims to reverse this trend, one creek at a time.
        </p>
        <h2 class="font-display text-2xl font-bold text-stone-900 mt-8 mb-4">How to Get Involved</h2>
        <p>
          Volunteer spots are still available for the March 15 kickoff event and subsequent weekend work sessions throughout April and May. No experience is necessary -- our team provides all training, tools, and materials. Just bring sturdy shoes, water, and a willingness to get your hands dirty.
