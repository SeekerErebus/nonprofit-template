        Bonneville Cutthroat Trout Population Reaches 10-Year High

        <p>
          In a milestone for conservation in the Wasatch, our latest population surveys reveal a 34% increase in Bonneville cutthroat trout numbers across monitored streams compared to 2020 baseline data. This is the highest count recorded in over a decade.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Bonneville cutthroat trout (Oncorhynchus clarkii utah) is Utah's state fish and a species of special concern. Once abundant throughout the Bonneville Basin, populations declined dramatically due to habitat degradation, competition from non-native species, and barriers to fish passage.
        </p>
        <h2 class="font-display text-2xl font-bold text-stone-900 mt-8 mb-4">What Drove the Recovery</h2>
        <p>
          Our wildlife biologist Dr. Amy Tanaka attributes the recovery to three factors: streambank restoration that improved water quality and reduced sedimentation, removal of passage barriers that allowed fish to access upstream spawning habitat, and careful management of non-native species in key watersheds.
        </p>
        <p>
          "This is what happens when you invest in long-term habitat restoration," said Dr. Tanaka. "The fish respond. The ecosystem responds. It's incredibly gratifying to see the data confirm what we've been working toward for years."
        </p>
        <h2 class="font-display text-2xl font-bold text-stone-900 mt-8 mb-4">What's Next</h2>
        <p>
          While the numbers are encouraging, the work is far from over. Climate change, drought, and continued development pressure remain significant threats. Our 2026 monitoring program will expand to include additional streams in the southern Wasatch, and we're planning new restoration projects in Little Cottonwood and Parleys Canyons.
